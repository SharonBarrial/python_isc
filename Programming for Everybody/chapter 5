#What is wrong with this Python loop?

python
Copy
Edit
n = 5
while n > 0 :
    print(n)
print('All done')
Answer: This loop will run forever
Explanation: The value of n is not being changed inside the loop, so the loop condition n > 0 will always be true, causing an infinite loop.

What does the break statement do? Answer: Exits the currently executing loop
Explanation: The break statement is used to immediately exit the loop, regardless of the loop condition.

What does the continue statement do? Answer: Jumps to the "top" of the loop and starts the next iteration
Explanation: The continue statement skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration.

zork = 0
for thing in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :

smallest_so_far = -1
for the_num in [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15] :
   if the_num < smallest_so_far :
      smallest_so_far = the_num
print(smallest_so_far)
Answer: -1
Explanation: The initial value of smallest_so_far is -1. Since all numbers in the list are greater than -1, the condition the_num < smallest_so_far is never true, and smallest_so_far remains -1.

What is a good statement to describe the is operator as used in the following if statement?

python
Copy

python
Copy
Edit
n = 0
while n > 0 :
    print('Lather')

print('Dry off!')
Answer: 0
Explanation: The condition n > 0 is false from the start, so the loop body will not execute at all. The program will immediately print 'Dry off!'.
