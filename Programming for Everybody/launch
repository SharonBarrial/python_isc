#3.3 Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
#Score Grade
#>= 0.9 A
#>= 0.8 B
#>= 0.7 C
#>= 0.6 D
#< 0.6 F
#If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit. For the test, enter a score of 0.85.

# Prompt for score
score = float(input("Enter a score between 0.0 and 1.0: "))

# Check if the score is within the valid range
if score < 0.0 or score > 1.0:
    print("Error: Score is out of range.")

4.6 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Put the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation. The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function.
